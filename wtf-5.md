# JavaScript please go home you're dunk! Or is it? ðŸ¤”

So previously we saw that JavaScript is not that good with maths, well, it is, but we human beings don't add 0.1 + 0.2 and get a result of 0.30000000000000004. However, what about the Math built-in library?

What's the result of the following expresion?

```JavaScript
console.log(Math.max() > Math.min());
```
